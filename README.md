# OTYOV - Choose Your Own Adventure Game

# Thousand Year Old Vampire
# A game by Tim Hutchings

Thousand Year Old Vampire is a lonely solo role-playing game in which you chronicle the unlife of a vampire over the many centuries of their existence, beginning with the loss of mortality and ending with their inevitable destruction. This vampire will surprise you as they do things that are unexpected, unpleasant, and sometimes tragic. Making gut-churning decisions, performing irreconcilable acts, and resolving difficult narrative threads are what this game is about as you explore the vampireâ€™s human failings, villainous acts, and surprising victories. 

Electronic version in progress by me. I claim no license, authorship, or other commercial qualities. This game seemed like a neat thing to cobble some code together for and automate some processes, teaching myself some UI aspects at the same time.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the `prompts.js` file. This file contains the prompts, choices, and outcomes that drive the game's narrative.

```javascript
const prompts = [
  {
    id: "1",
    a: "Your first prompt text here.",
    b: "Your second prompt text here.",
    // Add more choices as needed.
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    //...
  },
  // Add more prompts as needed.
];
```

You can add more prompts and choices to expand the game's storyline or modify existing ones to suit your narrative.

Enjoy playing OTYOV and exploring the life of a vampire character across the centuries!
